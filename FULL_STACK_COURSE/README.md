## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React

### Quick Start
1. **Follow the lessons in order** - Start with [01. Project Setup and Configuration.md](01_PROJECT_SETUP_AND_CONFIGURATION.md)
2. **Complete each lesson** - Don't skip ahead; each builds on the previous
3. **Test as you go** - Verify each step works before moving to the next
4. **Use the debug guide** - Reference [DEBUG_GUIDE.md](DEBUG_GUIDE.md) if you encounter issues

## üìñ How to Use This Course

### For Beginners
1. **Start with Lesson 01** - Complete the project setup step by step
2. **Read the explanations** - Use the additional files to understand concepts
3. **Practice the code** - Type out the code examples, don't just copy-paste
4. **Ask questions** - If something isn't clear, research or ask for help

### For Intermediate Developers
1. **Skip to relevant sections** - Focus on areas you need to improve
2. **Study the architecture** - Understand the design patterns and decisions
3. **Customize the code** - Modify examples to fit your needs
4. **Extend functionality** - Add features beyond what's covered

### For Advanced Developers
1. **Review the architecture** - Understand the design decisions
2. **Study the patterns** - Learn the state management and utility patterns
3. **Improve the code** - Identify areas for optimization
4. **Build upon it** - Use as a foundation for larger projects

## üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture

### Backend Architecture
```
Express Server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Middleware (CORS, JSON parsing, authentication)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API Routes (/api/users, /api/items, /api/orders)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Controllers (Business logic)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models (MongoDB schemas)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Configuration (Database, JWT, environment)
```

### Frontend Architecture
```
React Application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Context (Global state management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Components (UI components with local state)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Utilities (API communication and business logic)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Hooks (Custom React hooks)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Styling (SCSS with CSS modules)
```

### Data Flow
```
User Action ‚Üí Component State ‚Üí Utility Function ‚Üí API Call ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Database
     ‚Üì
Response ‚Üí State Update ‚Üí UI Re-render
```

## üß™ Testing Your Application

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test API endpoints with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

### Frontend Testing
- Use browser developer tools to check network requests
- Verify state changes in React DevTools
- Test authentication flow end-to-end
- Check error handling and loading states

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **MongoDB Connection**: Check `.env` file and connection string
- **JWT Authentication**: Verify token storage and middleware
- **CORS Errors**: Ensure backend CORS configuration
- **State Issues**: Check React component state management

### Getting Help
1. **Check the debug guide** - [DEBUG_GUIDE.md](DEBUG_GUIDE.md)
2. **Review the code explanations** - [CODE_EXPLANATIONS.md](CODE_EXPLANATIONS.md)
3. **Verify your setup** - Compare with the lesson examples
4. **Check console errors** - Look for specific error messages
